                        <h2>Video Conferencing</h2>
                        <p>Video conferencing is a technology that allows users in different locations to hold
                            face-to-face meetings without having to move to a single location together. This
                            technology is particularly convenient for business users in different cities or even
                            different countries because it saves time, expenses, and hassles associated with
                            business travel. Uses for video conferencing include holding routine meetings,
                            negotiating business deals, and interviewing job candidates.
                        </p>
